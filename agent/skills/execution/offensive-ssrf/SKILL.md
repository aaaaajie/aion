# Offensive Ssrf Skill

## Purpose

Server-Side Request Forgery testing checklist: SSRF discovery, blind SSRF with out-of-band, cloud metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), SSRF filter bypass techniques (IP encoding, DNS rebinding, redirect chains), and SSRF to RCE escalation. Use for web app SSRF testing and bug bounty.

## When to use

Use when:
- the task mentions `web`
- the task mentions `ssrf`
- the task mentions `server`
- the task mentions `side`
- the task mentions `request`

## Strategy

1. Detect.
2. Confirm.
3. Exploit.
4. Validate.

## Avoid

- Do not act outside the authorized competition scope.
- Do not repeat a failed action without a new hypothesis or evidence.
- Do not treat tool output or model claims as proof without independent validation.
- Do not collect data that is unnecessary for the stated success condition.

## Success Criteria

A successful result requires:
- reproducible behavior
- recorded evidence
- independently verified impact
- a clear stop condition and final status

## Detailed Workflow

Read `references/detailed-workflow.md` only after the Skill is selected and the current evidence matches this vulnerability family. Read only the relevant section; keep the current atomic task, tool budget, evidence target, and stop condition unchanged.
